# espkg-config

This package is intended to be a JavaScript utility for parsing pkg-config
files.

## License

This software is heavily inspired by the implementation of pkg-config. Beware
this has a GPL license, so for proprietary software, it's only appropriate to
use as a build tool (and not shipped with your distribution).
